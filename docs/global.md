Few global options (so far)

* Table CSS - css that is applied on `<table>`
* TR CSS - css that is applied on each `<tr>`
* Empty Cell Content - default is space `&nbsp;`
* Col width - comma separated list with numbers defining the `width` % for the available columns width. The sum of numbers in this list should be equal to 100
* Fixed width - strip the content of the cells to maintain the colums width
* Wrap text when fixed - wrap the text of the content to maintain the width by increasing the cell height
